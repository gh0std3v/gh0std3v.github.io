Hello! I'm an amateur programmer that's interested in theoretical mathematics.
Some books I would recommend reading:

* *The Art of Computer Programming* by Donald Knuth.
* *Innovators* by Walter Isaacson.
* *Who Owns the Future?* by Jaron Lanier.

> Unlimited tolerance must lead to the disappearance of tolerance. If we extend unlimited tolerance even to those who are intolerant, if we are not prepared to defend a tolerant society against the onslaught of the intolerant, then the tolerant will be destroyed, and tolerance with them.
