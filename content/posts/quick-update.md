Hey there.

I don't have much to write about today so I just want to provide a brief overview of my plans for tomorrow:

* Create Canvas-based chart (I decided not to use server-side generated charts)
  * Add labels/images to nodes
  * Improve Canvas resolution and performance
  * Add drag/pan
* Add tests for `scrape.py` and `server.py`
* Add tests and logging output for `*.py` and `client.js`
