I was working on my project today and I decided to try out a tool that I've been interested in using for a long time. Watson is a time management tracker that you can use to track how much time you spend on your projects. Today, according to Watson, I spent 1 hour and 11 minutes working on my project. 

I hope to use it more to track my time and hopefully in the future I can talk about the benefits/cons of using something like Watson.
