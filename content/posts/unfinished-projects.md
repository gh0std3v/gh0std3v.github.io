Hey there.

I dropped writing for a little bit just to give myself a break and give myself some time to work on my project. Speaking of projects, this year I've been trying to cultivate more persistence. I feel like in the past I would start a project, go somewhat far with it, and then fail to follow through and provide something that worked the way I wanted.

More critically, I didn't feel satisfied. I wanted to make something that I could be proud of. Leaving a project unfinished is one of the worst things that anyone who works on anything — be it software, academic papers, or something in the arts — can experience. It only leaves dread and a lack of confidence. Sure, you may learn something, but you don't get the feeling of satisfaction of completing the project and achieving your goals.
