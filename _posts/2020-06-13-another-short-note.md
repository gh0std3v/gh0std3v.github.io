It's been a week since I've written, so I thought I would spend some time sharing what I want to do for the upcoming week.

I made a note saying that I was going to read the *Nicomachean Ethics* and then continue reading Tocqueville's *Democracy in America*. The reason for this abrupt switch was because (1) I've always wanted to read Aristotle's work and (2) *Democracy in America* is longer than the *Nicomachean Ethics*. I'm almost finished with the book, so hopefully I can write a post summarizing its content and my thoughts on it this week.

In addition to that, I'm hoping that this week I can start working on some of my side projects. I've been putting them off because I was spending lots of time studying, but I think it would be good if I invested my time in those projects so they don't remain incomplete.

Like my last post, this was pretty short. Next week, I hope to write something more instructive :) .
