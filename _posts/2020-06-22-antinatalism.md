## Introduction

Antinatalism is the philosophical view that assigns a negative moral and ethical weight to procreation and birth. I've wanted to explore the subject for a while because I think the ramifications of antinatalism, especially in today's world, are extremely important. Should we subject future generations to the same — possibly worse — suffering as us? Or should we encourage people to have children in the hopes that they can better the world and reduce suffering? Can every human being live a happy life or are some destined to a dismal one? If we know someone will live a dismal life due to environmental or genetic factors that severely disadvantage them, is it morally right to put them in this world? Should parents have the final say in whether their child is born or should society intervene when it knows a certain child cannot be provided for? Do fetuses have, if any, "procreative rights" that dictate their birth or abortion? These questions are clearly important to answer not only because they pertain to the modern day but also because they are related to the past. Sterilization programs in China and India have demonstrated the ramifications of population control and represent the application of antinatalist ideology to prevent resource shortages and, consequently, mass suffering. On the opposite note, natalist policies in Denmark and Japan have shown the dire need of some countries to reproduce and, in essence, convince their citizens to adopt a natalist perspective. All in all, antinatalist thought is not just relegated to the abstruse musings of philosophers, but the pragmatic decisions of statesmen and humanity. 

## Description

Before we start discussing about antinatalism, it's important to clarify what antinatalism is. As stated above, antinatalism is the philosophical view that assigns a negative moral and ethical weight to procreation and birth. In essence, antinatalists believe that bringing a child into the world is immoral since it subjects them to suffering. Many antinatalists, like David Bentar, argue that human extinction is the best way to prevent suffering and no one should have any children. It's a common misconception that antinatalists are people who are extremists who wish to obliterate the human race through speciecide or suicide. Most antinatalists do not espouse this view. Rather, most believe that desisting from procreation is the best method to ensure the extinction of the human race since it's a morally neutral act, i.e, it does neither harm nor good to anyone. The particular thing to note about antinatalism is that the ideology considers life to be a negative experience; and so by having children, we merely are subjecting them to a negative experience which causes them to suffer. Therefore, according to antinatalists, we should not reproduce. 

## Defence of Antinatalism

One of the major proponents of antinatalism is David Benatar, most famous for his book *Better Never to Have Been: The Harm of Coming into Existence*. In essence, Benatar utilizes three arguments to defend antinatalism: asymmetry of pain and pleasure, uncertain quality-of-life, and misanthropy. 

​	The first argument concerns the asymmetry of pain and pleasure. Benatar's argument is this: Let there be a person $X$. Then, if $X$ exists, they they have (1) the presence of benefit and (2) the presence of bad. However, if $X$ doesn't exist, then they have (3) the absence of benefit and (4) the absence of pleasure. If you compare (1) and (2) to (3) and (4) respectively, then (1) and (2) will be *worse* than (3) and (4). The reasoning is as follows: since we assume by hypothesis that life is more bad than good, then (1) and (2) as a group will be a net negative. However, (3) and (4) are collectively good in terms of moral value, since the absence of bad is good and the absence of pleasure is not bad, but not necessarily good either (it's a neutral state). Thus, the combination renders the existence of $X$ to be worse than the non-existence of $X$. 

​	Now, the preceding argument that Benatar provides merely states that coming into existence is always bad but doesn't tell us why we shouldn't bring someone into existence. To answer that, Benatar states that people often tend to be biased when talking about their subjective well-being, leaning towards optimism, regardless of whether their objective conditions have worsened or not. He then proceeds to point out how everyday many of our desires are left unsatisfied and how pain tends to endure longer than pleasure. With a long list of examples, Benatar concludes with the idea that humans are optimistic to an almost delusional degree; this optimism prevents us from being able to see how bringing other people into the world seriously harms them. 

​	So far, Benatar has provided philanthropic reasons for not bringing humans into existence. His final argument comes from the other end: he argues that by bringing people into existence, you're potentially bringing in a human being that will *cause* suffering (in the previous argument, he stated that bringing a human being will lead to suffering being *effected* on them). In essence, he argues a misanthropic view on human nature. These three arguments summarize his defence of antinatalism.
