> Philosophy — a discipline comprising as its core logic, aesthetics, ethics, metaphysics, and epistemology

The above definition of philosophy is from Merriam Webster. Indeed, the core of philosophy consists of metaphysics, epistemology, logic, aesthetics, and ethics which deal with the study of the nature of reality, the study of knowledge, the study of good reasoning, the study of art and beauty, and the study of acting morally, respectively.

If you ask a philosopher, the definition of philosophy doesn’t appear to be very clear, though there are some [recurring notions](https://www.brainpickings.org/2012/04/09/what-is-philosophy/). However, I think the following answer to the question by A.W Moore is perhaps the best one:

> “I’m hard pressed to say, but one thing that is certainly true is that ‘What is Philosophy?’ is itself a strikingly philosophical question.”

This “strikingly philosophical question” is essential to understanding philosophy itself and why we need it. In school, most people learn “practical” subjects and “essential” skills. Philosophy, apparently unessential, is ignored, and most people learn the word as a pejorative term describing unending, unproductive rumination on unanswerable questions.

> Philosophy is the field of answering questions.

The reality is much starker. Contrary to the connotation, philosophy is not just faux profundity. Rather, philosophy is a critical field that has formed the groundwork of a variety of fields, including psychology, sociology, mathematics, science, religion, and politics. In fact, Newton had titled his most influential work, *Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy* because, at the time, physics was considered to be the “natural philosophy”. Indeed, physics was referred to as “natural philosophy” for quite some time until scientists separated themselves from philosophers. While the term philosophy has a negative connotation today, the reality is that many of us, at some point, engage in philosophical inquiry. If you’ve ever had an existential crisis, had trouble making friends, or have contemplated about yelling at someone, then you have engaged in a superficial form of philosophy (see [Albert Camus](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/camus/), [C.S Lewis & Ralph Emerson](https://www.brainpickings.org/2016/08/16/friendship/), [Buddha](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ethics-indian-buddhism/), respectively). Even though people scoff at philosophy as a field, it is, in reality, a vital foundation for most of the other subjects that exist today.

To answer the question —  what is philosophy? — is difficult. Perhaps the best answer I can give is that **philosophy is the field of asking questions**. Philosophy is about asking questions and providing answers. Whether those answers are satisfactory or not depends on your perspective. This countenance of subjectivity may make you feel dubious, but consider the fact that an argument against or for a philosophical question can be derived from empirical or theoretical evidence. Economic philosophies are based upon mathematical insights and empirical evidence. Political philosophies are based upon psychological and sociological data accrued over generations. Analytic philosophy is a style of philosophy that is based on providing argumentative rigor and precision. Clearly, philosophy is not just a field for liberal arts majors, it’s also a field for mathematicians, scientists, and technologists. Indeed, Bertrand Russel and Isaac Newton were philosophers. Descartes, a well-known philosopher who contemplated dualism and the tenets of critical thinking, also created the Cartesian coordinate system (read: graphing points on a plane).

> Philosophy is the remedy for an ill soul.

If we wish to live happy lives, then we shouldn’t try to turn to self-help gurus. There’s already thousands of years worth of philosophy to read and learn from. Mathematicians, artists, writers, engineers, logicians, politicians, economists, and doctors have all written extensively in the field of philosophy. And those same types of people have read and applied philosophy, too.

Except there’s one problem.

Philosophy is a gargantuan field. There are so many authors and so many perspectives about so many different topics that it’s hard to situate yourself in the beginning. There’s no *de facto* guide to philosophy, and any guides that do exist usually lie in translated texts or substantial textbooks that are too complicated to read.

I hope to at least partially solve this problem. Philosophy is something that everyone should at least dabble with during their lives. Philosophy develops our critical thinking and liberates the mind from the menial, unending tasks of life. Understanding philosophical concepts improves our understanding of politics, economics, science, love, and, most importantly, our daily life. Philosophy is the remedy for an ill soul. As Plato said:

> The unexamined life is not worth living.
