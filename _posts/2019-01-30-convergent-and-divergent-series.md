summary: Parsing my thoughts on convergent and divergent series.

I think I need to parse my thoughts when it comes to more technical subjects, especially mathematics. The standardized approach to learning mathematics taught in schools and (unfortunately) adopted my people like me attempting to learn math on their own is to read/listen about a certain topic and then practice it. While this approach may be beneficial for the short-term, it doesn't necessarily help retain things for the long-term. In order to become proficient in any technical subject, I've realized it's best to hold myself accountable by writing about these subjects. In university and secondary school you are held accountable for learning the material through grades and assessment. However, when it comes to personal learning, the individual is the only person that holds themselves accountable.

I thought that today I'll start this process by writing about convergent and divergent series.
