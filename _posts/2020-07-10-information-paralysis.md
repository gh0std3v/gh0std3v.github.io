*Being Mortal* tackles the hard questions we need to ask ourselves when we're on the verge of death. Atul Gawande discusses about the problems with health care for the elderly and the terminally ill, emphasizing the lack of concern for the socio-emotional and quotidian needs of those near the end of their life.

After reading the book, I realized that its subject is actually part of a broader problem in the twenty-first century. The book discusses about how many doctors in recent times have adopted a neutral, informational role in the patient-doctor relationship. Often times, doctors will overwhelm their patients with unfamiliar jargon and a selection of medical choices so vast that patients rarely understand how to choose between them. The Information Age has done something similar and, as a result, in a world full of information, we continue to ingest misinformation *ad nauseam*.

It's natural to ask why we do this. Even with all the information in the world, why do human beings make such poor decisions? With such amazing computational power literally at our fingertips, why do people base their decisions on unreliable sources? While selection bias and confidence bias (and laziness) play a crucial role here, **analysis paralysis** serves to completely disable us while online.

So, what is analysis paralysis? [Analysis paralysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_paralysis) is a term that describes what happens when someone overthinks a simple situation and is unable to come to a decision. It's what happens we you go shopping and become overwhelmed by the sheer variety of products. It's what happens when you are sitting down, skimming through Netflix, unsure of what to watch. It's what happens when you go on the Internet* to figure out whether the moon landing was fake and you delve deep into the rabbit hole of conspiracies, wondering who to believe.

The Internet is a situation where analysis paralysis makes itself inconspicuous. While scouring through search results trying to find what we want, we feel fatigued, frustrated, and, well, paralyzed. The overwhelming number of search results and the substantial amount of content contained within each link is enough to make even the most diligent netizen vexed. Again, while other biases do come into play, analysis paralysis helps to explain why even people who remain objective are unable to find quality information. Most people aren't power-users and most people aren't interested in becoming one (or even realize they can become one). As a result, most people aren't able to effectively use a search engine, hindering them from acquiring the information they want.

But forget learning how to use a search engine. Let's pretend you became a power user and you can find exactly what you want. There is still one insurmountable obstacle ahead. A single page on the Internet might have literally hundreds of thousands of links. Perusing each and every link is an arduous task. The extraordinary amount of cognitive effort and analysis needed *per page* can easily wear someone down. The fact of the matter is that **serial page analysis** — the process by which a user looks through a series of hyperlinks one-by-one — is inefficient. People become tired, hungry, frustrated, distracted. At some point, it becomes difficult to keep researching and, predictably, the user gives up.

Ideally, human beings would be able to perform **parallel page analysis**. However, people are [notoriously terrible at multitasking](https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=95256794) and with the overwhelming amount of information present, we risk exhausting ourselves. Therefore, in order to perform an analysis of this sort, it's clear we will need to somehow compress the vast amount of information from multiple pages on the Web into something easily digestible. There are bots that can do this, but the technology is still quite primitive. However the technology for parallel page analysis manifests (or something similar), we ultimately need to adhere to JCR Licklider's principle of human-machine symbiosis. Licklider was a computer scientist and psychologist in the 1960s who imagined how human beings would interface with computers to enhance themselves. His vision ([pronounced in his seminal essay](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/medg/people/psz/Licklider.html)) would inspire the creation of the mouse and keyboard. If the Internet is to mature, then, we need it to embody the spirit of his principle, i.e, we need it to become more user-friendly and, more importantly, reduce the amount of cognitive strain that people experience trying to find the information they need. Only then will we cure our paralysis.
