I've been trying to write everyday. It's not exactly consistent yet, but I'm getting there. The reason I staved off writing for a few days is because I was currently reading *Democracy in America* by Alexis de Tocqueville. I wanted to write some notes and thoughts on it just to record my opinion on the author's views and compare the America of then to the America of now. However, I thought I would read a book which I've been wanting to read for a long time, namely, *Nichomachean Ethics* by Aristotle. Generally, when I start a book, I hate to leave it unread. However, considering that I haven't read too far into it, I think I'll leave it for now and come back after I've finished *Nicomachean Ethics*. I wrote this post solely to record the fact that I'll be leaving the book I was currently writing thoughts and notes on for now and entering a different book. I'll pick up *Democracy in America* once I'm finished reading *Nicomachean Ethics*.
