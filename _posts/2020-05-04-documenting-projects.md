summary: How I'm going to document my progress to keep myself accountable.

I was thinking recently about an idea that I had. I've been on the Math StackExchange for a while now and, all considered, I love the instantaneous rendering of mathematics onto the screen when writing a question. The ability to see how the equation renders in real-time is pretty awesome.

Though I'm not particularly vexed with my blog's current setup, the most frustrating thing for me is rendering math. A lot of the equations I write are rendered awkwardly and I had some problems in the past with the equation going off the screen so that the user had to horizontally scroll in order to read the equation.

What's more striking to me is the lack of places on the Internet where people can write down mathematics and post it without much hassle. Granted, I'm speaking from a post-TEX era where equation-rendering is pretty good for the most part. However, the fact that popular sites like Medium don't automatically support the ability to render math equations is a bit irritating. I rarely post on Medium for other reasons now, but I think that the inability to smoothly render math plays a big part in that.

As a result, I thought that maybe I would make a site where people can write posts about mathematics more easily than with conventional tools like TEX-editors or likewise. More importantly, I want to document my progress via the project everyday so that I can track my progress and keep myself accountable. Maybe I'm just weird, but I have a feeling that consistently writing about the projects I take on will be a better way to keep myself accountable since it'll pressure me to make concrete progress in some way everyday. One of the biggest problems I have is that I can procrastinate when it comes to finishing projects on time. What I've noticed over the past couple days is that I've become more responsible when it comes to studying since I have the pressure of posting my progress on it everyday. I think applying that logic to my current projects will be a better way for me to keep track of my progress and actually make headway on them.

So, from tomorrow, I plan to discuss about this project: a site for writing mathematics that does the processing in real-time similar to the one on Math StackExchange. As of right now, I don't know how hard this project will be, but now that I've committed in this article, I can only go forward. On a broader level, I want to see how this experiment goes and see if documenting my progress daily will make me more effective.
