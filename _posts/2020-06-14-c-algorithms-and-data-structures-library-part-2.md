In this post, I wanted to talk about the library of C algorithms and data structures I was developing. After some thinking and messy implementation, I realized that implementing animations was a task that I think should be handled at a later time. Currently, I want to focus on implementing more algorithms and data structures, and I want to spend time discussing and demonstrating their properties. Therefore, I've decided to postpone discussion of animating these algorithms and data structures until a later date.

As of write now, the goal is to develop the library. In particular, I would like to add a singly-linked list, LIFO stack, and FIFO queue to the data structures portion. Additionally, I would like to add timing tests for the sorting methods and add LSD radix sort and MSD radix sort. After that point, I think implementing graph processing algorithms and data structures would be a logical next-step, though I'm not certain.
