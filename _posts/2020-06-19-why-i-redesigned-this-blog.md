To get straight to the point, I really hated the way this blog looked. I was using a template that I found off the Internet. Nothing was organized, leaving the documents I wrote scattered about tons of directories and subdirectories. All in all, it was a mess, it was disorganized, and it reflected in the articles I wrote. The quality was bad and I didn't feel motivated to write because everything felt so *cluttered*. 

That's why I decided to change the look. I stripped away the bland, inflated template I was using and I decided to try and build something that I could be proud of. I took away many of my old articles (currently they're stuffed in an `archived` directory) and completely changed the way this blog looks. While nothing's perfect and I still have some critical features that I want to implement, I'm proud of how this is going. Everything looks nice, clean, and tidy. It's strange, but it feels like I've also cleared my mind in the process. It feels like I've mentally cleaned my room.

So, I'm pretty happy of how things are right now and I'm looking forward to the future. While I don't want to write out a TODO list right here, I do want to mention how things will be organized in the future.

Basically, I'm going to categorized the articles I write into four groups: **mathematics**, **computer-science**, **thoughts**, and **ideas**. The first two groups are self-explanatory. The difference between **thoughts** and **ideas** is that **thoughts** will mainly concern my personal opinion on certain subjects whereas **ideas** will mainly be argumentative essays on certain topics.

I'll admit, the commit history for this blog on [GitHub](https://github.com/simulacr4m/simulacr4m.github.io) is horrible. It's probably messier than this blog used to be. Though I honestly don't care whether it's organized or not, considering I'm the only person writing  this blog. For now, this is my only post. Once I've finished development, I'll start writing more.
