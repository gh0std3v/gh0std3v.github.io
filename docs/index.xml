      <description>Hey there.
Recently, I needed to write some code in C to get the MAC address of a particular interface. On Linux, this is pretty easy to do. However, on BSD systems and, more importantly, on macOS, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t as straightforward and I had to do some digging to find an answer.
On Linux, generally I would find the MAC address by doing an ioctl() call with the argument SIOCGIFHWADDR like so:</description>

      <title>Unfinished Projects</title>

      <description>Hey there.
I dropped writing for a little bit just to give myself a break and give myself some time to work on my project. Speaking of projects, this year I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to cultivate more persistence. I feel like in the past I would start a project, go somewhat far with it, and then fail to follow through and provide something that worked the way I wanted.
More critically, I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel satisfied.</description>

      <title>Learning Rust</title>

      <description>Hey there.
I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to write yesterday because I was working on my project. In other news, I decided to learn a little bit of Rust through the Official Rust Book since I used to play around with the C programming language. So far, I&amp;rsquo;ve found Rust to be an interesting language that remedies some of the problems with &amp;ldquo;unsafe&amp;rdquo; languages like C while still attempting to give access to the low level.</description>

      <title>Watson Time Tracker</title>

      <description>I was working on my project today and I decided to try out a tool that I&amp;rsquo;ve been interested in using for a long time. Watson is a time management tracker that you can use to track how much time you spend on your projects. Today, according to Watson, I spent 1 hour and 11 minutes working on my project.
I hope to use it more to track my time and hopefully in the future I can talk about the benefits/cons of using something like Watson.</description>

      <title>Wikipedia Graph Update</title>

      <description>I wanted to give a quick update on the project that I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on. Today, I managed to render the nodes and links on the canvas and I think I also have a better understanding of D3.js than before. Of course, I think some optimizations can be made and it can be made more graphically appealing (labels on the nodes and drag/pan/zoom are two features that I definitely want to implement soon).</description>

      <description>Hey there.
I don&amp;rsquo;t have much to write about today so I just want to provide a brief overview of my plans for tomorrow:
 Create Canvas-based chart (I decided not to use server-side generated charts)  Add labels/images to nodes Improve Canvas resolution and performance Add drag/pan   Add tests for scrape.py and server.py Add tests and logging output for *.py and client.js  </description>

      <title>Fractional Knapsack</title>

      <guid>https://sshawarma.github.io/posts/2020/11/fractional-knapsack/</guid>
      <description>I wanted to explain the fractional knapsack algorithm since I recently solved a programming problem with it. However, I don&amp;rsquo;t want to try and explain the algorithm by just listing out the steps. Instead, I want to provide an intuitive description of the algorithm whereby I explain each step as we try to solve the problem.
Problem Given $n$ items each of which have a weight $w_k$ and price $p_k$, choose the items (not necessarily all) such that you choose the minimal price and the weight of the items is $\le W$.</description>

      <title>Trying Server Side Charts</title>

      <description>Hey there.
This is sort of an update to the article I wrote on trying to use D3.js network charts with canvas. However, after being away from this project for over two weeks and trying out Canvases, I realized a few things:
 Generating graphs with millions of nodes on the client side is horrible. If it were just a few thousand nodes, then it would be ok, but I&amp;rsquo;m generating so many nodes that many clients wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be able to handle it on their machine (regardless of whether we use Canvas or SVG).</description>

      <title>Why I Stopped Using Lastpass</title>
      <link>https://sshawarma.github.io/posts/2020/11/why-i-stopped-using-lastpass/</link>

      <guid>https://sshawarma.github.io/posts/2020/11/why-i-stopped-using-lastpass/</guid>
      <description>For the longest time I used to use Lastpass. It&amp;rsquo;s a pretty good password manager, but over time I started to have some concerns about whether I should keep using it. So, a few months ago, I deleted my Lastpass account and decided to get a local password manager.
So, why did I do it?
Lastpass is a great password manager without a doubt. Not only is it free, but you can auto-generate secure, random passwords and with its browser extension you can auto-fill password and username fields to make logging into your accounts faster.</description>

      <title>Combining Canvas and D3.js Network Charts</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on creating a network graph to show the relationship between every single Wikipedia article. I wanted to write this article so I can walk through the problem I&amp;rsquo;m having.
The Problem Basically, when I tried to render the network chart I decided to go the conventional route and use an SVG (Scalable Vector Graphic). SVGs are awesome for rendering different types of shapes and transitions. For a typical person rendering a few nodes on a network graph, SVGs work well (not to mention that pretty much every tutorial/article on using D3.</description>
