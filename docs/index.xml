      <description>Hey there.
I don&amp;rsquo;t have much to write about today so I just want to provide a brief overview of my plans for tomorrow:
 Create Canvas-based chart (I decided not to use server-side generated charts)  Add labels/images to nodes Improve Canvas resolution and performance Add drag/pan   Add tests for scrape.py and server.py Add tests and logging output for *.py and client.js  </description>

      <title>Fractional Knapsack</title>

      <description>I wanted to explain the fractional knapsack algorithm since I recently solved a programming problem with it. However, I don&amp;rsquo;t want to try and explain the algorithm by just listing out the steps. Instead, I want to provide an intuitive description of the algorithm whereby I explain each step as we try to solve the problem.
Problem Given $n$ items each of which have a weight $w_k$ and price $p_k$, choose the items (not necessarily all) such that you choose the minimal price and the weight of the items is $\le W$.</description>

      <title>Trying Server Side Charts</title>

      <description>Hey there.
This is sort of an update to the article I wrote on trying to use D3.js network charts with canvas. However, after being away from this project for over two weeks and trying out Canvases, I realized a few things:
 Generating graphs with millions of nodes on the client side is horrible. If it were just a few thousand nodes, then it would be ok, but I&amp;rsquo;m generating so many nodes that many clients wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be able to handle it on their machine (regardless of whether we use Canvas or SVG).</description>

      <title>Why I Stopped Using Lastpass</title>

      <description>For the longest time I used to use Lastpass. It&amp;rsquo;s a pretty good password manager, but over time I started to have some concerns about whether I should keep using it. So, a few months ago, I deleted my Lastpass account and decided to get a local password manager.
So, why did I do it?
Lastpass is a great password manager without a doubt. Not only is it free, but you can auto-generate secure, random passwords and with its browser extension you can auto-fill password and username fields to make logging into your accounts faster.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on creating a network graph to show the relationship between every single Wikipedia article. I wanted to write this article so I can walk through the problem I&amp;rsquo;m having.
The Problem Basically, when I tried to render the network chart I decided to go the conventional route and use an SVG (Scalable Vector Graphic). SVGs are awesome for rendering different types of shapes and transitions. For a typical person rendering a few nodes on a network graph, SVGs work well (not to mention that pretty much every tutorial/article on using D3.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I&amp;rsquo;ve written anything but I&amp;rsquo;ve decided as of today to start writing everyday for the sake of documenting the work I do and for keeping myself accountable.
That&amp;rsquo;s it.

      <description>Hey there!
I wanted to learn more about Pandas, a Python library for data analysis, so I decided to embark on a mini-project to experiment with it. If you use Reddit, you&amp;rsquo;ve probably seen a chain of comments like below:
Clearly, you can see that there&amp;rsquo;s a pattern in the number of upvotes. Every reply to the parent comment receives less upvotes compared to the previous reply. It would be interesting to create a bar graph, comparing the number of upvotes the parent comment received, the number of upvotes the first reply received, the number of upvotes the second reply received, &amp;hellip;, the number of upvotes the nth reply received.</description>

      <description>Hey there!
I just moved my blog from Jekyll to Hugo and I wanted to give a quick tutorial on how to use Hugo with GitHub pages.
Installation First, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to install Hugo:
MacOS: brew install hugo
Linux: brew install hugo (Here&amp;rsquo;s a link on how to install brew for Linux)
Windows: choco install hugo -confirm or scoop install hugo
Note: You may need to install Go.
Hugo on GitHub Pages Installing Hugo for GitHub Pages is pretty simple.</description>
