      <description>Hey there.
I haven&amp;rsquo;t been writing recently because I got busy with school/work and felt too tired to write anything. I&amp;rsquo;m hoping that this week I can start writing everyday again.

      <description>Hey there.
I dropped writing for a little bit just to give myself a break and give myself some time to work on my project. Speaking of projects, this year I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to cultivate more persistence. I feel like in the past I would start a project, go somewhat far with it, and then fail to follow through and provide something that worked the way I wanted.
More critically, I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel satisfied.</description>

      <title>Why I Stopped Using Lastpass</title>

      <description>For the longest time I used to use Lastpass. It&amp;rsquo;s a pretty good password manager, but over time I started to have some concerns about whether I should keep using it. So, a few months ago, I deleted my Lastpass account and decided to get a local password manager.
So, why did I do it?
Lastpass is a great password manager without a doubt. Not only is it free, but you can auto-generate secure, random passwords and with its browser extension you can auto-fill password and username fields to make logging into your accounts faster.</description>

      <title>Writing Everyday</title>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I&amp;rsquo;ve written anything but I&amp;rsquo;ve decided as of today to start writing everyday for the sake of documenting the work I do and for keeping myself accountable.
That&amp;rsquo;s it.
