      <description>I wanted to give a quick update on the project that I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on. Today, I managed to render the nodes and links on the canvas and I think I also have a better understanding of D3.js than before. Of course, I think some optimizations can be made and it can be made more graphically appealing (labels on the nodes and drag/pan/zoom are two features that I definitely want to implement soon).</description>

      <description>Hey there.
This is sort of an update to the article I wrote on trying to use D3.js network charts with canvas. However, after being away from this project for over two weeks and trying out Canvases, I realized a few things:
 Generating graphs with millions of nodes on the client side is horrible. If it were just a few thousand nodes, then it would be ok, but I&amp;rsquo;m generating so many nodes that many clients wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be able to handle it on their machine (regardless of whether we use Canvas or SVG).</description>
