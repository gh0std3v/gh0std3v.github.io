      <title>Wikipedia Graph Update</title>

      <description>I wanted to give a quick update on the project that I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on. Today, I managed to render the nodes and links on the canvas and I think I also have a better understanding of D3.js than before. Of course, I think some optimizations can be made and it can be made more graphically appealing (labels on the nodes and drag/pan/zoom are two features that I definitely want to implement soon).</description>

      <title>Fractional Knapsack</title>

      <description>I wanted to explain the fractional knapsack algorithm since I recently solved a programming problem with it. However, I don&amp;rsquo;t want to try and explain the algorithm by just listing out the steps. Instead, I want to provide an intuitive description of the algorithm whereby I explain each step as we try to solve the problem.
Problem Given $n$ items each of which have a weight $w_k$ and price $p_k$, choose the items (not necessarily all) such that you choose the minimal price and the weight of the items is $\le W$.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on creating a network graph to show the relationship between every single Wikipedia article. I wanted to write this article so I can walk through the problem I&amp;rsquo;m having.
The Problem Basically, when I tried to render the network chart I decided to go the conventional route and use an SVG (Scalable Vector Graphic). SVGs are awesome for rendering different types of shapes and transitions. For a typical person rendering a few nodes on a network graph, SVGs work well (not to mention that pretty much every tutorial/article on using D3.</description>

      <title>Plotting Reddit Comment Trends With Pandas</title>

      <description>Hey there!
I wanted to learn more about Pandas, a Python library for data analysis, so I decided to embark on a mini-project to experiment with it. If you use Reddit, you&amp;rsquo;ve probably seen a chain of comments like below:
Clearly, you can see that there&amp;rsquo;s a pattern in the number of upvotes. Every reply to the parent comment receives less upvotes compared to the previous reply. It would be interesting to create a bar graph, comparing the number of upvotes the parent comment received, the number of upvotes the first reply received, the number of upvotes the second reply received, &amp;hellip;, the number of upvotes the nth reply received.</description>
